# Chapter 1. The Current State and Future Directions of IT Technology

---

## Industrial revolutions
- 1st: Steam power mechanized manual labor; 2nd: Electricity enabled mass production; 3rd: PCs, electronics, and the internet digitized cognition; 4th: AI and advanced communications augment human decision‑making.
- The shift moves from machines replacing labor to AI systems complementing or replacing aspects of human thinking.

## Fourth Industrial Revolution
- Built on hyper‑connectivity and hyper‑intelligence, driven by AI, autonomous robots, and virtual reality; transforms industrial structures and systems.
- Future directions: “connected intelligence” at scale, rise of platforms, and rapid AI advances via hardware, networks, and models that boost speed, efficiency, and capability.

## 4IR core keywords
- ICT for hyper‑convergence: networks, mobile platforms, content, apps, cloud, e‑learning linking all computing and data.
- AI for hyper‑intelligence: invisible engines with large‑scale models and self‑learning/decision abilities. IoT for hyper‑connection, Fintech for cashless finance, Big Data for large‑scale prediction, and Blockchain for distributed security.

## 5G capabilities
- eMBB up to 20 Gbps peak, user‑experienced speeds ~100 Mbps, spectral efficiency gains, mobility up to 500 km/h, latency near 1 ms, and device density up to 1M/km² enabling massive IoT and ultra‑reliable low‑latency services.

## Toward 6G
- Machine‑centric networks with new form factors (VR/XR/holograms) and hundreds of billions of connected devices; satellite‑based mobile services anticipated around 2029.
- Features: ultra‑wideband, wide‑area coverage, extreme connectivity, ultra‑low power, precise positioning, and ultra‑low latency with high reliability.

## 6G requirements
- Peak data rate ~1 Tbps, user‑experienced rate ~1 Gbps, air latency ~100 µs, 100× connection density vs 5G, and long battery life (e.g., AA for 20 years).
- Media evolution from 3D (5G) to multi‑dimensional 5D (6G) with coverage up to ~10 km altitude.

## Cloud and DX
- Digital transformation accelerates with cloud adoption; cloud blends sharing and subscription economies and extends from centralized data centers to edge computing.
- Edge computing places compute/storage near devices to cut latency and cost, ideal for big‑data and sub‑10 ms IoT scenarios.

## Cloud service and deployment models
- Service models: IaaS (virtualized infrastructure), PaaS (managed runtime, tools, frameworks), SaaS (ready‑to‑use software).
- Deployment: private, public, hybrid, multi‑cloud, and hybrid‑multi configurations tailored to enterprise needs.

## Strategic tech themes
- Optimization: digital immune systems, observability, and AI trust/risk/security to maximize value.
- Scale: industry cloud platforms, platform engineering, and wireless innovations (LEO satellites, private 5G/Wi‑Fi, NFC, BT, GPS).
- Pioneering: metaverse/XR, super‑apps, adaptive AI with continual learning, and sustainability across environment and society.

## Human–AI work and skills
- Past revolutions replaced physical labor and created new jobs; the 4th targets cognitive tasks, making human‑AI teaming central.
- Required competencies emphasize the 4Cs: critical thinking, communication, collaboration, and creativity, alongside self‑understanding to retain agency in an AI‑driven world.
